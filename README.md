# Pull Request Commands

`pr-command` is an action that enables you to run commands on your pull requests using comments.

This action will be triggered on comments on pull requests: it checks-out your pull request, runs a command, and commits the result back to the branch.

When the command is started, a ðŸš€ is added as a reaction on the comment, and when the command is finished and changes are committed, a ðŸŽ‰ is added as a reaction. If the command fails, ðŸ˜• is added as a reaction.

This can be used for anything, but examples include:
- `!pr lint` lints the code.
- `!pr update-screenshots` updates screenshots for visual regression tests.
- `!pr coverage` generates coverage reports
- `!pr dedup` deduplicates yarn packages in `yarn.lock`.

# Usage
<!-- start usage -->
```yaml
name: <insert action name>

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  <insert action name>:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: siteimprove/pr-command@v1
        with:
          # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository and add reaction on comment (See note about token)
          token: ''
          # Comment that the action should be triggered on.
          # Note: if the comment contains special characters it needs to be wrapped as a string ''
          # Example: '!pr lint'
          pr-comment: ''
          # Command to be run when the comment has been written
          run: ''
          # Commit message of the changes
          commit-message: ''
```
<!-- end usage -->

## Note: Token
An authentication token is required in order to fetch the repository and add reactions on the comment.
If you use the action in a personal repository, you can create a [PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (Personal access token).
If you use the action in an organization, you probably want to use a PAT from an organizational user.

Normally the `GITHUB_TOKEN` would have been sufficient, but Github Actions blocks that in order to prevent recursive workflow runs.

> When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs. - [Github Action docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow)
