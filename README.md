# Pull Request Commands

`pr-command` is an action that enables you to run commands on your pull requests using comments.

This action will be triggered on comments on pull requests: it checks-out your pull request, runs a command, and commits the result back to the branch. It can also write a comment on the PR.

There is a [simple](simple/README.md) and an [advanced action](advanced/README.md)
